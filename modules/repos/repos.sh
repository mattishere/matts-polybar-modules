# Here we make use of multiple tools. Let me explain what's going on:
# - First off, we're using "curl" to fetch the GitHub API, as well as adding the "-s" flag to hide the progress bar.
# - After we have fetched the API, we use "grep" to get the data we want ("public_repos").
# - Using "awk", we then only take the integer.
# - Finally, we make use of "tr" to remove the comma.
