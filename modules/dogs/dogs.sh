# This is where we get the random breed. We're making use of Dog CEO, which is an API that can send us a random dog breed.
# This is how it works:
# - First, we use "curl" with a "-s" flag (to hide the progress bar) to fetch the API.
# - Using "json_pp", we format the returned JSON from our request.
# - We then use "grep" to get the line we want.
# - Using "awk", we take the part of the line that has the breed.
# - Finally, we use "tr" to remove the double quotations (") and the comma (,).
